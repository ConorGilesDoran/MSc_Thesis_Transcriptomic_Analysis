### Project title:
"Transcriptomic analysis of the substantia nigra reveals alterations in key biological systems involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease"

### Main objectives:

1.	Merge SN gene expression data generated from independent microarray studies for a statistically high-powered transcriptomic analysis of the SN in PD cases and healthy controls. 
2.	Use the merged microarray dataset to perform differential gene expression and functional enrichment analyses of SN tissue in PD cases and healthy controls. 
3.	Perform differential gene expression analysis of individual laser-captured dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and compare to the results obtained from the whole SN.
4.	Use the merged microarray dataset to perform weighted gene co-expression network analysis of SN tissue in PD cases and healthy controls, for the detection of biologically relevant differentially co-expressed gene sets. 
5.	Achieve a comprehensive tissue-wide insight into the molecular alterations and mechanisms contributing to PD at the transcriptome-level of the SN.

#### limma_results:

Results generated from differential gene expression analysis of the merged microarray dataset, including a plot of the top 30 most signifcant differentially expressed genes.

#### Processed:

Results generated from pre-processing procedures, including the combined_array, the pre-processed merged dataset and the pre-processed sample metadata. 
Note that certain objects, such as the 'full_processed_list.rds', could not be uploaded to its file size. 

#### WGCNA:

Results generated from the WGCNA_workflow.R script.

Module_info - Contains module eigengenes (MEs), module genes, signedKME for all genes with all modules (kMEtable), signedKME of each gene for its associated module (moduleKME) and hub genes.

Over-rep - Contains results from GO over-representation analysis of specific module gene sets.

Plots - Contains all plots associated with the WGCNA workflow.

RDS_objects - Contains all .rds objects associated with the WGCNA workflow. Certain files were too large for uplaod.
